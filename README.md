# Archmaker

This is a project in development aimed to make an easy-to-use, efficient and somewhat automatic tool to automatically install and configure a freshly installed arch linux system. It currently supports [my own config files](https://github.com/lae-laps/dotfiles/) aswell as any other repo which follows the real structure of files or uses the notation specified in the docs.

A lot of features are in development and it is a standing project.
